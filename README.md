# Agricultural-study-India
In this project, I do descriptive analysis study of the Indian agricultural production from the year 1997 to the year 2014.

## Table of contents
1. Data Set - Crop_production1.csv : The original dataset which used for the study.
2. Pranay_agricultural_project.ipynb : It is the Jupyter Notebook containing detailed python codes which is used for analyzing the original dataset.
3. Pranay_Crop_production_case_study.pdf : It is the final project report.

## Installation
The following libraries are need to run the Jupyter Notebook,
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. matplotlib

## Project Motivation
Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for most of the Indian population. It employs approximately 52% of the labor. Its contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is between 14% to 15%. In this project, we study more extensively the agricultural dynamics of India from the year 1997 to the year 2014. My primary motivations for studying the COVID 19 dataset are given below,
1. What is the time series progression of the production of staple foods of India, which are primarily rice and wheat?
2. What are the states producing the highest average production of rice and wheat?
3. What is the average distribution of crops grown during Rabi and Kharif seasons?
4. What is the time series progression of the total available agricultural land in India?

## Result and discussion
The detailed discussion of the following graphs are given in the [**Pranay_Crop_production_case_study.pdf**](https://github.com/pranay1990/Agricultural-study-India/blob/main/Pranay_Crop_production_case_study.pdf). Below we show the obtained results for the aforesaid project motivations.
